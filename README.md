# dnd-map-helper
Quickly look up location descriptions by clicking on a corresponding map region.

# Requirements
- Allow multiple regions
  - e.g. Main map -> town map -> building map
  - need to be able to jump to specific regions without going through all the maps
    - possibly a nested sidebar?
    - potential clash between the description of a region and it's corresponding map. Show description and button to go to map?

  - Should have hyperlinks to locations in descriptions, with breadcrumbs and browser history
    - Should be able to see all locations referencing the current one. Need a data structure that allows to see all outgoing and incoming links efficiently.

  - TBC
